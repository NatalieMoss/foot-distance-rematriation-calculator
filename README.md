# Foot Distance Rematriation Calculator ü¶∂üìè‚ôÄÔ∏è

Did you know that the foot as an imperial unit of measure was based on the actual foot length of King Henry the I 900 years ago? Imagine a world where a standard unit of measure was based on a woman's body instead. The Measurement Rematriation Committee* (MRC) determined that Queen Nefertiti's foot size is the new standard. It is called the nefeet. And now YOU can begin to re-measure your world accordingly, with a feminist ruler.

## Description
This program take the user's description of an object to be converted, as well as their preference of inputting imperial decimal feet or imperial decimal inches. The program returns the distance measured in the new unit, the "nefeet." The program also takes the user's age for the output message and asks if the user would like to convert another measurement to nefeet.  The program uses a while loop to ask the user if they want to input another measurement to convert to nefeet. Once the user is done, the program asks the user if they would like to create a unit of measurement based on their own foot length and what they would like to call it. A statement prints out giving the conversion factor of their custom named unit of measurement. The program uses a class Thingy to construct objects with the fields _description and _length_nefeet, rather than storing these attributes in separate lists.
## Input:       
Description of the distance measured, choice of imperial inchesor imperial feet, the distance in the chosen unit, and theuser's age. A second input prompt asks the user if they wantto create a unit of measurement based on their own foot and whatthey wish to call it. User input is validated using validationfunctions. The program accepts all version of y/n inputs, variations on foot and inch spellings (In, INCHES, ft, etc), requires that age is an integer between 0 and 120, accepts only positive numbers for distance inputs.
## Output:     
The user's chosen distance measurement converted from imperial to nefeets along with their age when they learned this and the option to perform another conversion. The second output, if the user wants to create their own unit of measurement is the conversion factor for converting decimal imperial feet to their unit.
